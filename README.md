# music_generation

This project is the first step of a bigger project: creating a music with different instrument and including the timing using neural network.

In this version, only one instrument is allowed and the time (the time between two notes or chords) is not generated by the neural networ but manually implemented.

The goal to this project is to show how we can apply NLP techniques to music. I hope it will also help people startign with text/music generation and don't know how to start. In this idea, I will describe all step and try to use the simplest solution and premade function/class.

This project is mainly based on two library: Pytorch for the neural network and music21 for data preprocessing.
